# Security Best Practices

## Data Privacy

- Use `anonymization.py` to ensure customer data is anonymized before storage.
- Encrypt sensitive data using `data_encryption.py`.

## Authentication

- Implement JWT-based authentication (`jwt_auth.py`) to secure API access.

## Access Control

- Role-based access control is managed using `rbac.py`.

## Auditing

- All access to models and data is logged using `audit_log.py`.

## Encryption

- Ensure all customer data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption methods.
